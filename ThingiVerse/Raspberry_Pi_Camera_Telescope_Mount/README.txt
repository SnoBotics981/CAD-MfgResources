# Summary

This is a mount that allows a Raspberry Pi camera (v1 or v2) to be used in a telescope for astrophotography. The eyepiece will fit any 1.25" focuser. To use the Pi Camera for astrophotography you will need to remove the lens that covers the sensor, this can be done with a pair of long nosed pliers, carefully gripping the lens and rotating. YOU MUST GRIP THE CIRCULAR PART AND NOT THE SQUARE PART.

There are two files, one for the eyepiece that goes into the focuser and another for a cap that sits over the top, you will also need the following:

* 4off M3x12 Cap Head Bolts
* 4off M2x4 Cap Head Bolts

You may want to use a longer data cable that is available on the internet depending on how far away from your Pi you have the camera (mine is attached to the body of the telescope).

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: Fisher 1
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1 - 0.2
Infill: 15% rectilinear

Notes: 
Printed well for me with a 200C setting for all layers, 0.2mm resolution but you can go finer (and I will for the final version).

# Post-Printing

## Assembly

Once printed assembly is very simple, use the M2 bolts to attach the camera PCB to the cap (this assumes you have already removed the lens from the camera to enable photography to take place), the data cable should lie towards the edge with the cut-out. Ensure that the camera is pointing up. Next line up the eyepiece with the camera and use the 4 M3 bolts to secure the two together, ensure that the bolt heads are on the cap side as pictured. That's all there is to it.
