# Summary

I printed a camera case for the Raspberry Pi v2 and I needed a tool that I could use to focus the camera's lense without having to remove the case. This tool does just that, it prints relatively quickly and it will only cost you a penny in PLA!

If you are careful, you can get the tool in place (looking through the hole in the back of the tool) and then position the camera and use it as a focus ring until you get things dialed in before removing it.

FYI, before you use this tool, you should take a hobby knife and carefully sever the glue locations so that the lense will rotate freely.

My time and PLA went into designing this thing. If this design blesses your life in some way, feel free to favor me with a tip as thanks. Gratuities are not required, but are definitely appreciated. You can tip me any amount that you would like here: https://www.paypal.me/brysonjack
Make sure to include a comment telling me which design it is. Thanks in advance.

# Print Settings

Printer: Monoprice Maker Select v2.1
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: .05mm
Infill: Print Solid

Notes: 
Because this is an extremely small part, print it at the highest resolution that you can and print it slow so that it comes out correctly.

# Post-Printing

Clean with a hobby knife if necessary.
